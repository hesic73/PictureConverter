**PictureConverter** is a simple, toy project developed with Qt 5.15.2. It provides a basic GUI for users to convert image files between different formats. Users can add images by dragging and dropping or by using a file dialog, view basic image information, select an output directory, and choose the desired output format for the conversion.
